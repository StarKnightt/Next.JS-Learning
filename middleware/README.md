# Middleware in Next.js 

- Middleware in Next.js allows you to run code before a request is completed. 

- It helps to modify the request, changing the request, like before reaching the destination we can change the data in the middle, allowing you to modify, redirect or enhance the request data as needed.

- This can be useful for tasks such as authentication, logging, or document preparation. 

- Below is an example of how to create middleware for document preparation in a Next.js application.
