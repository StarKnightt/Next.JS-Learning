### Server Components

- In Next.js 13, Server Components were introduced as a key part of the new App Router. 

- They bring a whole new way to handle data fetching, performance optimization, and rendering in React. With Server Components, much of the heavy lifting (like fetching data, rendering HTML, etc.) happens on the server, which means your app can be faster, leaner, and more efficient.
