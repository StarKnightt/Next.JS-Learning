# Script, Link and Image Component

- Next.js has some built-in components that make working with JavaScript, links, and images easier, faster, and more efficient. 

- The Script, Link, and Image components each solve a common web development issue and help make websites more efficient and user-friendly.

## Link Component

- The Link component in Next.js is used to create internal links within the application. 

- Itâ€™s optimized to make page transitions fast and smooth.

- Built for client-side navigation (no full page reload).

- Automatically pre-fetches linked pages (only on production).

- check the 'components' folder for the usage of Link component.

- For example,

```
// Import the Link component
import Link from 'next/link';

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My Site</h1>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>Go to About Page</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomePage;

```
